When I lined up my Week09 solutions against the instructor’s code, a few things jumped out at me: I didn’t add type hints or cover edge cases like None inputs, while their version included full annotations and guard clauses. I also accidentally shadowed Python’s built-in sum() function with my variable name and stuck with more generic names, compared to their descriptive ones. While my comments got to the point, theirs walked through each step and showed multiple optimizations, which really helped illustrate how to polish code. My iterative loops worked, but I took a more manual approach to counting and didn’t build in quick tests to check results on the fly. Moving forward, I’ll focus on sprinkling in type hints, handling all the unexpected inputs, choosing clear variable names, experimenting with optimizations, and adding simple print tests so I catch mistakes early.
